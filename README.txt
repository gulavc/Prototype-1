Most game parameters can be played with on the GameManager object.

There are 6 different sub-levels, generated randomly everytime a new seed is chosen, and the default level is 10 sub-levels long.

Here are some preset seeds to test specific things:
0 : This seed will place all sub-levels in order.
1 - 6 : These seeds will make a level from repeating a single sub-level, in order to test one of them individually.
